# Contribution Guide

This project is open to any contribution activities. We love active participants and pull requests from everyone, especially Delphi developers. 

## Contribution - documentation and demos

We will be more than happy if you:
* add new MD pages into the [docs](docs/) folder (most required at the moment)
* correct any grammatical errors in this file, in the [README.md](README.md) or in any file
* add new demos into the [Demos](Demos/) folder
* improve source code documentation (using XML Documentation inside source PAS files or adding MD files into the [docs](docs/) folder)

## Contribution - bug fixes and issues

If you would like to:
* fix bugs
* add new functionality

Please discuss this via GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/andrea-magni/MARS/issues) instead of sending a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/andrea-magni/MARS/pulls). Please [open a new issue](https://github.com/andrea-magni/MARS/issues/new/choose) and we will try to guide you on what to do next. We are very happy for each new functionality idea and will discuss it with you. Please be aware that we would like to keep the project small and consistent and because of that, some great ideas could be closed if they are requested as an issue.

> Please do not send a **Pull Request** with bug fixes or new features without discussion in advance and acceptance of the author.

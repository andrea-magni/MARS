# Contribution Guide

This project is open for any contribution activities. We love active participants and pull requests from everyone, especially Delphi developers. 

## Contribution - documentation and demos

We will be more than happy if you:
* add new MD pages into the doc folder (most required at that moment)
* correct any grammatical errors in this file, in the README.md or in any file
* add new demos into the demos folder, 
* improve source code documentation (using XML Documentation inside source PAS files or adding MD files into doc folder)

## Contribution - bug fixes and issues

If you would like to:
* fix bugs
* add new functionality

Please discuss this via GitHub `Issues` instead of send new `Pull Request`. Please register new issue and we will try to navigate you what to do next. We are more than happy for each new functionality idea and we will discuss this with you. Please be aware that we would like to keep project to be small and consistent, because of that some great ideas could be close if it will be requested as an issue.

> Please do not send **Pull Request** with bug fixes or new features without discussion in advance and acceptance of the author.
